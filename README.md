## Requirements

The code is build with an pre-release version of the protocol-buffers compiler using v3.20.0-rc1.
Please be adivsed that the build requires the protocol-buffers dependency to be v3.20.0-rc2 or higher in order to work. This enables us to provide pyi files to help with type linting in the IDE. As soon as a stable version of v3.20.0 is released, we will switch to that release and mark v3.20.0 as the minimal protobuf version. This means that python has to be v3.7 or higher.

All dependecies can be found in the requirements.txt of the example.
